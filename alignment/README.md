# Readme

The `eflomal_*` are jupyter notebooks experimenting with eflomal on Tok Pisin (tpi) and the GNT (byz) and Unfolding Word's ULB (now ULT).

I have experimented with my own alignment algorithms to produce tpi-esv-align.txt. This file uses standard alignment format except that I tab separated a bcv reference at the beginning of the line. The ESV is copyrighted, so this file does include any ESV text.
